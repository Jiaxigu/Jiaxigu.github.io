This is a birthday episode on miscellaneous things.

## Apple Music Analyzer

[Apple Music Analyzer](https://music.samthegeek.net/) is a handy third-party tool to analyze and visualize my personal data on apple music, since the official stats are surprisingly lacking. Items including most played artist, most played song, favorite genre and playing time heatmap are supported end-to-end.

## Raft

A [really nice visualization](https://raft.github.io/) of raft algorithm. Works well to demonstrate key features of raft: follower, candidate, leader, election, timeout, and log replication.
