#### Fisher Guatemala Finca Miramundo Gesha Washed COE#23

  - **Light Roast, Berry, 64.4¥/100g**
  - **Flavor: 6** The berry-ish first touch is well balanced. Doesn't match the diversity that a Gesha usually boasts though.
  - **Aftertaste: 7** For a short period of time, a sweet note of tea, apple and passionfruit takes over and brings the experience to next level. However, the time window is so narrow and it's all downhill from here.
  - **Texture: 6** Quite good balance and mouthfeel at start, but a gust of sourness follows up when coffee colds down.
  - **Aroma: 6** Mild aroma of tea and berry.

#### Black Diamond Colombia Finca El Porvenir Gesha Washed

  - **Light Roast, Tea and Orange, 59¥/100g**
  - **Flavor: 8** Tea flavor in general, supported by colorful tastes of orange and jasmine. The first sips make a truly exceptional experience.
  - **Aftertaste: 6** Nutty taste builds up over time.
  - **Texture: 6** Good balance in the drip. Body is not very nice though.
  - **Aroma: 7** Catchy aroma consisting of herb and honey from the beans and all the way to the drip.

#### MQ Rwanda Nova Red Bourbon Natural

  - **Light Roast, Berry, 18.1¥/100g**
  - **Flavor: 6** Grape, blackberry. Pleasant berry flavor overall.
  - **Aftertaste: 6** Sweetness stands out over the course, but overall it's pretty monotone.
  - **Texture: 7** Excellent balance and mouthfeel. Body is event better. Quite impressive out of a light roast.
  - **Aroma: 6** Mild fruity aroma.

#### MQ Papua New Guinea Boka Arusha Washed

  - **Light Roast, Tomato, 18.8¥/100g**
  - **Flavor: 7** Abundant tomato-like sour-sweetness. Pleasantly exotic.
  - **Aftertaste: 5** Astringency amplified. It doesn't build up from the amazing first impression, unfortunately.
  - **Texture: 5** Dry and sharp. Just like when you swallow up too much tomato.
  - **Aroma: 7** Dense aroma that usually comes from a deeper roast. I call it armors from ancient landlord. 

#### MQ Yunnan Pu'er Menglian Honey

  - **Light Roast, Sugar, 16.4¥/100g**
  - **Flavor: 6** Dominant sweetness, but it's shallow and transient. I guess the anaerobic honey processing helped, but just a bit.
  - **Aftertaste: 6** The sweet tone is stable, but could use a bit more variety.
  - **Texture: 6** Good balance but the clean cup is bad. A woody defection is ever-present.
  - **Aroma: 6** Refreshing aroma, however the weak strength corresponds to its shallow flavor.
