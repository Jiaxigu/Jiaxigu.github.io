title: Rate the Drip 2022

Here are all coffee beans I shopped for pour-over coffee in 2022. I will give a try to rate and review them, all in once.

## Criteria

Drinking coffee is a personal experience, so I have to do some research before putting everything into a numerical scale.

The descriptive criteria don't judge if a coffee is good or bad, they describe the coffee's traits or factual characteristics. 

- Roast level (which implies acidity): light, medium, dark.
- Identity: One or multiple comparable tastes to define the coffee's main identity.
- Price: Price/performance ratio also has a say in the whole experience.

On the contrary, the evaluative criteria shows how much credit I give to each aspect of a coffee. 

- Flavor (30%): Are the flavor characteristics evident, pleasant and special? 
- Aftertaste (30%): Is the aftertaste durable and consistent over time? Does it have a pleasant twist?
- Texture (30%): Body, balance, clean cup and other factors that contribute to the oral experience.
- Aroma (10%): The nasal experience.


## Setup

- grinder: Mavo Wizard
- steeper: Hario Switch
- scale: Timemore Black Mirror 2
- technique: water-first steep
- coffee to water: 13g/210mL
- duration: 90s (light roast) to 100s (medium roast)

## Reviews

The drip ladder is here. The budget Gesha from Black Diamond is the clear winner. Two berry-flavored coffee resemble the art of balance and complete the podium for my 2022.

Following are the detailed reviews sorted by price in descending order.

#### Fisher Guatemala Finca Miramundo Gesha Washed COE#23

  - **Light Roast, Berry, 64.4¥/100g**
  - **Flavor: 6** The berry-ish first touch is well balanced. Doesn't match the diversity that a Gesha usually boasts though.
  - **Aftertaste: 7** For a short period of time, a sweet note of tea, apple and passionfruit takes over and brings the experience to next level. However, the time window is so narrow and it's all downhill from here.
  - **Texture: 6** Quite good balance and mouthfeel at start, but a gust of sourness follows up when coffee colds down.
  - **Aroma: 6** Mild aroma of tea and berry.
  - **Summary: Underperformance against its price.**

#### Black Diamond Colombia Finca El Porvenir Gesha Washed

  - **Light Roast, Tea and Orange, 59¥/100g**
  - **Flavor: 8** Tea flavor in general, supported by colorful tastes of orange and jasmine. The first sips make a truly exceptional experience.
  - **Aftertaste: 6** Nutty taste builds up over time.
  - **Texture: 6** Good balance in the drip. Body is not very nice though.
  - **Aroma: 7** Catchy aroma consisting of herb and honey from the beans and all the way to the drip.
  - **Summary: Scoop of the year.**

#### Fisher Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Worka Washed G1 (L)

  - **Light Roast, Tea, 21.4¥/100g**

  - **Aftertaste: 5** Wheat dethrones tea very quickly, which brings a monotone aftertaste with a bit of astringency. 
  - **Texture: 6** Good clean cup but lacks a bit body.
  - **Aroma: 6** Mild tea aroma.
  - **Summary: A good choice for your first specialty coffee.**

#### Fisher Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Worka Washed G1 (M)
  - **Medium Roast, Peach, 21.3¥/100g**
  - **Flavor: 6** Very bland fruit flavor, mostly peach. Yirgacheffe at medium is not very exciting.
  - **Aftertaste: 6** No huge evolvement. Leans on the verge between tea and fruit forever.
  - **Texture: 6** Also lacks body but solid texture overall.
  - **Aroma: 6** Enduring aroma from the beans but nothing out of the drip.
  - **Summary: Won't be remembered for long.**

  - **Light Roast, Tomato, 18.8¥/100g**
  - **Flavor: 7** Abundant tomato-like sour-sweetness. Pleasantly exotic.
  - **Aftertaste: 5** Astringency amplified. It doesn't build up from the amazing first impression, unfortunately.
  - **Texture: 5** Dry and sharp. Just like when you swallow up too much tomato.
  - **Aroma: 7** Dense aroma that usually comes from a deeper roast. I call it armors from ancient landlord.
  - **Summary: Exotic, but too exotic for me.**

![](https://jiaxi-github-pages-photohost.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/pyreneesalpaca/images/2022-06-24-arusha.png){: .center-image}

#### MQ Rwanda Nova Red Bourbon Natural

#### MQ Yunnan Pu'er Menglian Honey

  - **Light Roast, Honey, 16.4¥/100g**
  - **Flavor: 6** Dominant sweetness, but it's shallow and transient. I guess the anaerobic honey processing helped, but just a bit.
  - **Aftertaste: 6** The sweet tone is stable and goes even stronger in the late stage, but definitely could use a bit more variety.
  - **Texture: 6** Good balance but the clean cup is bad. A tiny woody feel is ever-present.
  - **Aroma: 6** Refreshing aroma, however the weak strength corresponds to its shallow flavor.
  - **Summary: Nothing to remember about this one, good or bad.**
