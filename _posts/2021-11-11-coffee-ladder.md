title: Ranking Drip Coffee Bags
tags: Data
---

I have been consuming drip coffee bags regularly for two years and I would like to rank them, all at once. Drinking coffee is a personal experience, so I did some research and made a try to put everything into a numerical scale.

There are two types of criteria: descriptive and evaluative.

The descriptive criteria don't judge if a coffee is good or bad, they describe the coffee's traits or characteristics. 

- Roast level (which implies acidity): light, medium, dark
- Texture: One or multiple comparable tastes to define the coffee's identity

On the contrary, the evaluative criteria shows how much credit I give to each aspect of a coffee. 

- Flavor (50%): the taste when the coffee is in the mouth. 
- Aftertaste (30%): well, the aftertaste.
- Aroma (20%): the smell before taking the first sip.
