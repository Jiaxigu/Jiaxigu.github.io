title: Ranking Drip Coffee Bags
tags: Life
---

I have been consuming drip coffee bags regularly for two years and I would like to rank them, all at once. Drinking coffee is a personal experience, so I did some research and made a try to put everything into a numerical scale.

There are two types of criteria: descriptive and evaluative.

The descriptive criteria don't judge if a coffee is good or bad, they describe the coffee's traits or characteristics. 

- Roast level (which implies acidity): light, medium, dark
- Type: body, balanced, sweet

On the contrary, the evaluative criteria shows how much credit I give to each aspect of a coffee. 

- Flavor (50%): the taste when the coffee is in the mouth. 
- Aftertaste (15%): well, the aftertaste.
- Aroma (15%): the smell before taking the first sip.
- Cost-effectiveness (20%): the price performance ratio.

## Detailed Reviews

- **Sinloy 01 Espresso: Body Dark Roast, Score: 3.1**
  - **Flavor: 3.0**. Strong and bitter. A pure adrenaline booster without too much to enjoy.
  - **Aftertaste: 2.5**. Chocolatey, but then deteriorate into causticness.
  - **Aroma: 3.0**. Pleasant chocolatey smell, but not enduring.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 4.0**. Costs 1.7 RMB per bag. The budget version of illy bold roast.
- **Sinloy 02 Blue Mountain: Balanced Medium Roast, Score: 3.8**
  - **Flavor: 4.0**. A balanced roast in all means. Never a wrong choice on any day.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.0**. Starts ok with blueberry, but then sourness grows with time.
  - **Aroma: 2.0**. Raw smell, probably cocoa or chocolate. Far from being enjoyable, unfortunately.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 5.0**. Can't ask for anything better for just under 1.7 RMB per bag.
- **Sinloy 03 Cherry Blend: Sweet Medium Roast, Score: 3.3**
  - **Flavor: 3.0**. A big blend of fruits. Feels too artificial to me.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.5**. Start with wine, but loses freshness with time.
  - **Aroma: 3.0**. Fresh cherry smell.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 4.0**. One of the expensive roasts in the Sinloy lineup at 2.4 RMB per bag. The extra money buys uniqueness, but not quality. 
- **Sinloy 04 Yirgacheffe: Balanced Light Roast, Score: 3.5**
  - **Flavor: 3.5**. The acidity is catchy, but feels like being shelved for years though.
  - **Aftertaste: 4.5**. Sharp sour aftertaste, with lingering lemon and mint flavor. The best part of the experience.
  - **Aroma: 2.5**. The light citrus smell checks out with its flavor but vanishes quickly.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 4.0**. Lives up to expectation as the most expensive roast among the Sinloy lineup at over 3.5 RMB per bag.
- **Sinloy 05 Hambela: Sweet Light Roast, Score: 3.9**
  - **Flavor: 4.0**. Fresh sweet flavor. Tastes like juice.
  - **Aftertaste: 4.0**. Strawberry and passion fruit.
  - **Aroma: 3.5**. Still strawberry, but overall it's a bit artificial, or more like fructose. 
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 4.0**. For 3.4 RMB per bag it's good.
- **Illy Intenso Bold Roast: Body Dark Roast, Score: 3.6**
  - **Flavor: 4.0**. Strong bitter flavor. The harsh taste provides boost on a day when I'm ready to kick some ass.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.5**. Smoky and nutty aftertaste that lasts.
  - **Aroma: 4.0**. The catchy carbony smell checks out with its flavor.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 2.5**. I was a frequent buyer when it was around 5 RMB per bag. But for over 7.1 RMB per bag now, I don't feel like this brew could justify its price.
