title: Ranking Drip Coffee Bags
tags: Life
---

I have been consuming drip coffee bags regularly for two years and I would like to rank them, all at once. Drinking coffee is a personal experience, so I did some research and try to put everything into a numerical scale. The criteria are:

- Flavor (50%): the taste when the coffee is in the mouth. 
- Acidity (15%): the aftertaste.
- Aroma (15%): the smell before taking the first sip.
- Cost-effectiveness (20%): the price performance ratio.

## The Ladder

## Detailed Review

- **Sinloy 01 Espresso: 3.1**
  - **Flavor: 3.0**. Full bitter flavor without variety. A pure adrenaline booster without too much to enjoy.
  - **Acidity: 2.5**. Bland bitterness followed by a weird combination of sour and causticness.
  - **Aroma: 3.0**. Pleasant pungent smell, but not as enduring as espresso should normally do.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 4.0**. The budget version of illy bold roast, but the quality fails to catch up.
- **Sinloy 02 Blue Mountain: 3.8**
  - **Flavor: 4.0**. Standard blue mountain flavor. Mild and mellow, welcoming and pleasurable. Never a wrong choice on any day.
  - **Acidity: 3.0**. Mild acidity with almost no bitterness. The layers of aftertaste is limited.
  - **Aroma: 2.0**. Not much aroma to expect other than some weak nutty smell.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 5.0**. Can't ask for anything better for just under 1.7 RMB per bag. On _double-11_ it costs 1.2 RMB per bag. Insane value.
- **Illy Intenso Bold Roast: 3.6**
  - **Flavor: 4.0**. As the name suggests, it's has a strong, bitter flavor. The harsh taste provides boost on a day when I'm ready to kick some ass.
  - **Acidity: 3.0**. Smoky aftertaste makes every sip a rocket-ride experience.
  - **Aroma: 4.0**. An unforgettable aroma. The enduring carbony smell checks out with its flavor.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 2.5**. I was a frequent buyer when it was around 5 RMB per bag. But for over 7.1 RMB per bag now, I don't feel like this brew could justify its price.
