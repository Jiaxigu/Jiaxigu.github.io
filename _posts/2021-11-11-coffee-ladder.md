title: Ranking Drip Coffee Bags
tags: Life
---

I have been consuming drip coffee bags regularly for two years and I would like to rank them, all at once. Drinking coffee is a personal experience, so I did some research and made a try to put everything into a numerical scale.

There are two types of criteria: descriptive and evaluative.

The descriptive criteria don't judge if a coffee is good or bad, they describe the coffee's traits or characteristics. 

- Roast level (which implies acidity): light, medium, dark
- Type: body, balanced, sweet

On the contrary, the evaluative criteria shows how much credit I give to each aspect of a coffee. 

- Flavor (50%): the taste when the coffee is in the mouth. 
- Aftertaste (15%): well, the aftertaste.
- Aroma (15%): the smell before taking the first sip.
- Cost-effectiveness (20%): the price performance ratio.

## Detailed Reviews

- **Sinloy 01 Espresso: Body Dark Roast, Score: 3.1**
  - **Flavor: 3.0**. Strong and bitter. A pure adrenaline booster without too much to enjoy.
  - **Aftertaste: 2.5**. Chocolatey, but then deteriorate into causticness.
  - **Aroma: 3.0**. Pleasant chocolatey smell, but not enduring.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 4.0**. Costs 1.7 RMB per bag. The budget version of illy bold roast.
- **Sinloy 02 Blue Mountain: Balanced Medium Roast, Score: 3.8**
  - **Flavor: 4.0**. A balanced roast in all means. Never a wrong choice on any day.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.0**. Starts ok with blueberry, but then sourness grows with time.
  - **Aroma: 2.0**. Raw smell, probably cocoa or chocolate. Far from being enjoyable, unfortunately.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 5.0**. Can't ask for anything better for just under 1.7 RMB per bag.
- **Sinloy 03 Cherry Blend: Sweet Medium Roast, Score: 3.3**
  - **Flavor: 3.0**. A big blend of fruits. Feels too artificial to me.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.5**. Starts with wine, but loses freshness with time.
  - **Aroma: 3.0**. Fresh cherry smell.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 4.0**. One of the expensive roasts in the Sinloy lineup at 2.4 RMB per bag. The extra money buys uniqueness, but not quality. 
- **Sinloy 04 Yirgacheffe: Balanced Light Roast, Score: 3.6**
  - **Flavor: 3.5**. The acidity is catchy, but feels like being shelved for years though.
  - **Aftertaste: 4.5**. Sharp sour aftertaste, with lingering lemon and mint flavor. The best part of the experience.
  - **Aroma: 2.5**. The light citrus smell checks out with its flavor but vanishes quickly.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 4.0**. Lives up to expectation as the most expensive roast among the Sinloy lineup at over 3.5 RMB per bag.
- **Sinloy 05 Hambela: Sweet Light Roast, Score: 3.6**
  - **Flavor: 3.5**. Fresh sweet flavor. For me the sweetness is a bit too much so that the coffee tastes like juice.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.5**. Strawberry and passion fruit. It doesn't finish well though, tastes like artificial fructose in the end.
  - **Aroma: 3.5**. Strawberry, has that artificial feeling too.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 4.0**. For 3.4 RMB per bag it's good.
- **Illy Intenso Bold Roast: Body Dark Roast, Score: 3.7**
  - **Flavor: 4.0**. Strong bitter flavor. The heavy body is unique and enjoyable.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.5**. Smoky, nutty aftertaste that lasts.
  - **Aroma: 4.0**. The catchy carbony smell checks out with its flavor.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 3.0**. I was a frequent buyer when it was around 5 RMB per bag. But for over 7.1 RMB per bag now, it takes a second thought.
- **AGF Blendy Special Blend: Balanced Dark Roast, Score: 3.3**
  - **Flavor: 3.0**. Mild bitter flavor with sparkling sweet. Not a fan of this setup but I can understand why.
  - **Aftertaste: 2.5**. Artificial sweet aftertaste without variety.
  - **Aroma: 3.5**. Vanilla and syrup.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 4.5**. Surprisingly cheap at 2 RMB per bag.
- **Peet's Signature Blend: Body Dark Roast, Score: 3.0**
  - **Flavor: 3.0**. A weird dark roast. Smells sweety but acidity gradually takes over.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.0**. Starts with dark chocolate, then the sourness loses control.
  - **Aroma: 4.0**. Chocolate and caramel. 
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 2.0**. An easy pass at 7.6 RMB per bag.
