title: Rate the Drip

I have been consuming drip coffee bags regularly for two years and I would like to rank them, occasionally. Drinking coffee is a personal experience, so I did some research and made a try to put everything into a numerical scale.

There are two types of criteria: descriptive and evaluative.

The descriptive criteria don't judge if a coffee is good or bad, they describe the coffee's traits or characteristics. 

- Roast level (which implies acidity): light, medium, dark
- Texture: One or multiple comparable tastes to define the coffee's identity

On the contrary, the evaluative criteria shows how much credit I give to each aspect of a coffee. 

- Flavor (50%): the taste when the coffee is in the mouth. 
- Aftertaste (30%): well, the aftertaste.
- Aroma (20%): the smell before taking the first sip.

- **Illy Intenso Bold Roast: Dark Roast, Caramel**
  - **Flavor: 3.4**. Strong bitter flavor. The heavy body is unique and enjoyable.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.5**. Smoky, nutty aftertaste that lasts.
  - **Aroma: 4.0**. The caramel smell checks out with its flavor.
- **AGF Blendy Special Blend: Dark Roast, Syrup**
  - **Flavor: 3.3**. Mild bitter flavor with sparkling sweet. Not a fan of this setup but I can understand why.
  - **Aftertaste: 2.8**. Artificial sweet aftertaste without variety.
  - **Aroma: 3.5**. Vanilla and syrup.
- **Peet's Signature Blend: Dark Roast, Chocolate**
  - **Flavor: 3.1. A weird dark roast. Smells sweet but acidity gradually takes over.
  - **Aftertaste: 2.8. Starts with dark chocolate, then sourness loses control.
  - **Aroma: 4.0**. Chocolate and caramel. 
- **Fisher Costa Rica Tarrazu Caturra Miel: Medium Roast, Honey and Almond**

  - **Aroma: 3.0**. Nutty aroma.
