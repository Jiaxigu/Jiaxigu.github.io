title: Rate the Drip - A New Project
tags: Coffee
---

I have been consuming pour over coffee (from both roasted beans and drip bags) regularly for two years and now I would like to rate them. Drinking coffee is a personal experience, so I did some research and made a try to put everything into a numerical scale.

There are two types of criteria: descriptive and evaluative.

The descriptive criteria don't judge if a coffee is good or bad, they describe the coffee's traits or characteristics. 

- Roast level (which implies acidity): light, medium, dark
- Identity: One or multiple comparable tastes to define the coffee's main identity

On the contrary, the evaluative criteria shows how much credit I give to each aspect of a coffee. 

- Flavor (30%): Are the flavor characteristics evident, pleasant and special? 
- Aftertaste (30%): Is the aftertaste durable and consistent over time? Does it have a pleasant twist?
- Texture (30%): Body, balance, clean cup and other factors that contribute to the oral experience.
- Aroma (10%): The nasal experience.
