title: Ranking Drip Coffee Bags
tags: Life
---

I have been consuming drip coffee bags regularly for two years and I would like to rank them, all at once. Drinking coffee is a personal experience, so I did some research and made a try to put everything into a numerical scale.

There are two types of criteria: descriptive and evaluative.

The descriptive criteria don't judge if a coffee is good or bad, they describe the coffee's traits or characteristics. 

- Roast level (which implies acidity): light, medium, dark
- Sweetness: low, semi, full

On the contrary, the evaluative criteria shows how much credit I give to each aspect of a coffee. 

- Flavor (50%): the taste when the coffee is in the mouth. 
- Aftertaste (15%): well, the aftertaste.
- Aroma (15%): the smell before taking the first sip.
- Cost-effectiveness (20%): the price performance ratio.

## The Ladder

## Confirmed Review

- **Sinloy 02 Blue Mountain: Medium Roast, Semi Sweet, Score: 3.8**
  - **Flavor: 4.0**. A balanced roast in all means. Never a wrong choice on any day.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.0**. Weak blueberry in the aftertaste, but then sourness grows with time.
  - **Aroma: 2.0**. Mild chocolatey smell. Far from being enjoyable, unfortunately.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 5.0**. Can't ask for anything better for just under 1.7 RMB per bag. On _double-11_ it costs 1.2 RMB per bag.

## First Impressions

- **Sinloy 01 Espresso: Dark Roast, Low Sweet, Score: 3.1**
  - **Flavor: 3.0**. Full bitter flavor without variety. A pure adrenaline booster without too much to enjoy.
  - **Aftertaste: 2.5**. Chocolatey aftertaste, deteriorate into causticness in the end.
  - **Aroma: 3.0**. Pleasant chocolatey smell, but not enduring.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 4.0**. Costs 1.7 RMB per bag on a regular day. The budget version of illy bold roast, but the quality fails to catch up.
- **Sinloy 03 Cherry Blend: Medium Roast, Full Sweet, Score: 3.3**
  - **Flavor: 3.0**. Not a fan of fruity blend. This one feels too artificial to me.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.5**. The mild winey sour starts amazingly, but loses freshness with time.
  - **Aroma: 3.0**. The beans offer a fresh cherry smell but once brewed the aroma will disappear.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 4.0**. One of the expensive beans in the Sinloy lineup at 2.4 RMB per bag. The extra money buys uniqueness, but not quality. 
- **Sinloy 04 Yirgacheffe: Light Roast, Medium Sweet, Score: 3.5**
  - **Flavor: 3.5**. Sweet and sour. The sourness feels like being shelved for years though.
  - **Aftertaste: 4.5**. Sharp sour aftertaste, with lingering lemon and mint flavor. The best part of the experience.
  - **Aroma: 2.5**. The light citrus smell checks out with its flavor but vanishes quickly.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 4.0**. Lives up to expectation as the most expensive bean among the Sinloy lineup at over 3.5 RMB per bag. However, the beans are not well-grained so that the dripping process becomes really hard as water begins to cool down.
- **Sinloy 05 Hambela: Light Roast, Full Sweet, Score: 3.9**
  - **Flavor: 4.0**. Strawberry
  - **Aftertaste: 4.0**.
  - **Aroma: 3.5**. Probably 
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 4.0**. 
- **Illy Intenso Bold Roast: Dark Roast, Low Sweet, Score: 3.6**
  - **Flavor: 4.0**. As the name suggests, it's has a strong, bitter flavor. The harsh taste provides boost on a day when I'm ready to kick some ass.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.5**. Smoky aftertaste makes every sip a rocket-ride experience.
  - **Aroma: 4.0**. An unforgettable aroma. The enduring carbony smell checks out with its flavor.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 2.5**. I was a frequent buyer when it was around 5 RMB per bag. But for over 7.1 RMB per bag now, I don't feel like this brew could justify its price.
