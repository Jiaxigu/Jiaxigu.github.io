title: Ranking Drip Coffee Bags
tags: Life
---

I have been consuming drip coffee bags regularly for two years and I would like to rank them, all at once. Drinking coffee is a personal experience, so I did some research and made a try to put everything into a numerical scale.

There are two types of criteria: descriptive and evaluative.

The descriptive criteria don't judge if a coffee is good or bad, they describe the coffee's traits or characteristics. 

- Roast level (which implies acidity): light, medium, dark
- Texture: One or multiple comparable tastes to define the coffee's identity

On the contrary, the evaluative criteria shows how much credit I give to each aspect of a coffee. 

- Flavor (50%): the taste when the coffee is in the mouth. 
- Aftertaste (15%): well, the aftertaste.
- Aroma (15%): the smell before taking the first sip.
- Cost-effectiveness (20%): the price performance ratio.

- **Sinloy 05 Hambela: Light Roast, Strawberry, Score: 3.7**
  - **Flavor: 3.6**. Fresh sweet flavor. For me the sweetness is a bit too much so that the coffee tastes like juice.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.5**. Strawberry and passion fruit. It doesn't finish well though, tastes like artificial fructose in the end.
  - **Aroma: 3.5**. Strawberry, has that artificial feeling too.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 4.0**. For 3.4 RMB per bag it's ok.

  - **Aftertaste: 3.5**. Smoky, nutty aftertaste that lasts.
  - **Aroma: 4.0**. The caramel smell checks out with its flavor.
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 3.0**. I was a frequent buyer when it was around 5 RMB per bag. But for over 7.1 RMB per bag now, it takes a second thought.
- **AGF Blendy Special Blend: Dark Roast, Syrup, Score: 3.3**

  - **Aroma: 4.0**. Chocolate and caramel. 
  - **Cost-effectiveness: 2.0**. An easy pass at 7.6 RMB per bag.
