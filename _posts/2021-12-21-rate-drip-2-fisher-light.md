## Details

- **Fisher Gesha Blend: Light Roast, Berry**
  - **Flavor: 3.5**. Fruity themed flavor. Enjoyable overall but could use a bit more distinction.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.8**. Starts with berry, then acidity picks up as coffee cools down.
  - **Aroma: 2.8**. Very weak fruity smell.
- **Fisher Ethiopia Worka Washed: Light Roast, Tea and Citrus**
  - **Flavor: 3.6**. Floral and tea themed flavor. Similar taste to Yirgacheffe.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.2**. Nothing special at beginning. Citrus takes over after coffee cools down.
  - **Aroma: 4.4**. Very fun aroma. Floral scent with a hidden note of green tea.
- **Fisher Ethiopia Aricha Natural: Light Roast, Wine**
  - **Flavor: 3.2**. Fruity themed flavor. Lack of variety and the acidity doesn't develop well.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.2**. Nothing special except from a weak note of, possibly, mango.
  - **Aroma: 3.3**. Fruit wine, but fades quickly.
- **Fisher Kenya Dormans SL28/34 Washed: Light Roast, Lemon**
  - **Flavor: 3.6**. Fruity themed flavor, it develops well when getting cold.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.5**. Nothing special at first. Notes of lemon and citrus start to show up when coffee cools down.
  - **Aroma: 3.2**. Ordinary fruity aroma.
- **Fisher Yunnan Zuo's Catimor Washed: Light Roast, Almond**
  - **Flavor: 3.7**. Smooth touch and trivial sweetness. Despite all of this, it lacks identity.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.0**. Almond.
  - **Aroma: 2.8**. Nothing special.
- **Fisher Yunnan Paliang Catimor Anaerobic: Light Roast, Berry**
  - **Flavor: 3.6**. Balanced touch with a fruity note. Distinguishable is my best comment.
  - **Aftertaste: 2.9**. Berry. Finishes badly with rough sourness.
  - **Aroma: 3.4**. Fruity and milky aroma.
