This is a minimalist poster of all the Champions League semifinalists in the last 20 years.

Observations:

- Atletico and Barcelona are mutually exclusive
- City and Bayern are ALMOST mutually exclusive
- RM and OL(wow) are mutually exclusive
- Chelsea is arguably the most stable English side in the CL

Two questions:

- I have to manually arrange the teams so that all but one instance of consecutive appearance would show in the same column. Any algorithm could do the job better and faster?
- Any package/software/AI pipeline could generate these kind of posters like a pro?
