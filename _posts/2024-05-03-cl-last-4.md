This is a minimalist poster of all the Champions League semifinalists in the last 20 years.

Observations:

- Atletico and Barcelona are mutually exclusive
- City and Bayern are ALMOST mutually exclusive
- RM and OL(wow) are mutually exclusive
- Chelsea arguably the most stable English side in the CL

Two questions remained:

- Any algorithms to arrange the teams so that teams who made consecutive appearances could stay in the same column as many as possible?
- Any package/software/AI pipeline to generate these kind of posters asap?
