The dust has settled at FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. This tournament saw Messi crowned, Mbappe peaked, tenacity triumphed, tiki-taka suffocated.

## Disclaimer

I implemented the bot and drew all xG maps myself, but the idea and design comes 100% from [Michael Caley](https://twitter.com/mc_of_a).

## Matches

Let's start with upsets. The biggest upset was _Argentina v. Saudi_ for sure, but this match is a blessing in disguise for Argentina.

The other upsets were less extraterrestrial given the context of cup format, where caution and tenacity are the most valuable assets. Matches like _Germany v. Japan_, _Croatia v. Brazil_ are evidences of that verdict.

Both Morocco wins in the knockout phase are more due to great tenacity and strict tactics. They are not far behind in xG.

An honorable mention is worthy for the _England v. France_ match. England woed on missed chance once again.

Talking about missed chances, _Croatia v. Belgium_ is definitely a jaw-dropping one.
