The 5th episode centers around the idea of AIOps.

## AIOps at Meituan

Meituan has a [nice write-up](https://tech.meituan.com/2020/10/15/mt-aiops-horae.html) about AIOps implementation at production level. An AIOps system requires input from three different job models.

- Machine learning algorithms. Machine learning engineers curate a bunch of algorithms on time series anomaly detection, time series classification and multivariate root cause analysis.
- Learnwares. SREs fit solutions into automated pipelines. Such pipeline, powered by machine learning algorithms, called learnware, is designed to tackle a series of similar faults without repetitive inputs (which often lead to misoperations).
- AIOps platform. Backend engineers design and develop a platform that facilitate the learnware lifecycle: design, development, validation, integration and maintenance.

## MLOps

[MLOps](https://ml-ops.org/) is a set of practices that focus on model deployment and management at scale. To differentiate from AIOps, the object of the whole `-Ops` thing is machine learning models. It's a vital part in AIOps for sure, since the idea of learnware requires that its ML model should be deployed systematically and reliably. A benchmark of MLOps is [Michelangelo by Uber](https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo-machine-learning-platform/).

## Feature store

The idiom `feature` is popular among data scientists, but the idea of [feature store](https://www.tecton.ai/blog/what-is-a-feature-store/) is even more important in parallel systems, especially in those with heterogeneous database. [Feast](https://www.datarevenue.com/en-blog/feature-store-feast-vs-hopsworks) is a standalone, open source solution but it still has a long journey ahead.
