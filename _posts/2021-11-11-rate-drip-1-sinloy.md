## Details

- **Sinloy 01 Espresso: Dark Roast, Chocolate**
  - **Flavor: 3.2**. Strong and bitter, but not much enjoyable.
  - **Aftertaste: 2.5**. Chocolatey, but then deteriorates into causticness.
  - **Aroma: 3.0**. Chocolatey smell with ok quality.
- **Sinloy 02 Blue Mountain: Medium Roast, Berry**
  - **Flavor: 3.8**. A balanced roast in all means.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.0**. Starts ok with blueberry, but then sourness grows with time.
  - **Aroma: 2.8**. Probably cocoa or chocolate. Raw but not enjoyable.
- **Sinloy 03 Cherry Blend: Medium Roast, Cherry and Wine**
  - **Flavor: 3.3**. A big blend of fruits. Feels a bit artificial to me.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.2**. Starts with wine, but loses freshness with time.
  - **Aroma: 3.5**. Fresh cherry smell.
- **Sinloy 04 Yirgacheffe: Light Roast, Mint and Lemon**
  - **Flavor: 3.6**. The acidity is catchy, but feels like being shelved for years though.
  - **Aftertaste: 4.5**. Sharp sour aftertaste, with lingering lemon and mint flavor. The best part of the experience.
  - **Aroma: 2.7**. The light citrus smell checks out with its flavor but vanishes quickly.
- **Sinloy 05 Hambela: Light Roast, Strawberry**
  - **Flavor: 3.6**. Fresh sweet flavor. For me the sweetness is a bit too much so that the coffee tastes like juice.
  - **Aftertaste: 3.5**. Strawberry and passion fruit. It doesn't finish well though, tastes like artificial fructose in the end.
  - **Aroma: 3.5**. Strawberry, has that artificial feeling too.
