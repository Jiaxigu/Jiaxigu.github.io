At the second half of 2023 I have gradually forged a stable training schedule. In this post I want to review the six whole months that I can be really proud of with data visualizations.

Another calendar in month grid style, from strava.

- Swim: 37.45k / 18h49m / 44 days
- Ride: 747.3k / 33h46m / 19 days
- Run: 35.8k / 4h23m / 9 days

## New year plan

I have set new targets for 2024 based on the experiences gathered from the trial run:

- min. 15k swim, 400k ride and 100k run per quarter. That is 10x triathlon worth of distance per Q.
- avg. 2.5h of training per week. A session is at least 30min long. An extensive training can count towards multiple sessions, except for cycling. A long ride counts as max. 3 sessions.
- avg. 32.5h of training per quarter. Consistent with the weekly goal.
