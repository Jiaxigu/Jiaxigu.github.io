At the second half of 2023 I have gradually forged a stable training schedule. In this post I want to review the six whole months that I can be really proud of with data visualizations.

The first one is a self-made heatmap calendar of daily activities, decorated with weekly training hours.

The second one is a monthly grid screenshot from strava.

And we say goodby to this year with some key numbers by sport:

- Swim: 37.45k / 18h49m
- Ride: 747.3k / 33h46m
- Run: 35.8k / 4h23m

## New year plan

I have also set new numbers for 2024:

- distance: 15k swim, 400k ride and 100k run per quarter. That is 10x triathlon worth of distance per Q.
- duration: 32.5h of training per quarter. That is 2.5h per week in average.

And now off to a new year with the water, the tarmac, and the track!
