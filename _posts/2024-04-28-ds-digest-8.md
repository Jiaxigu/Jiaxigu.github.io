## IOL 

International Lingusitics Olympiad(IOL) is one of the International Science Olypiads for secondary school students. Recently, out of curiosity, I gave a try with IOL problems from past editions (which are available [here](https://ioling.org/problems/by_year/)), and I have surprisingly good results. What a shame I didn't have any idea about IOL in my middle high! =)
