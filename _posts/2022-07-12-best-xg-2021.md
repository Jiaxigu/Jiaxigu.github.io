title: Best xG Maps from Season 21/22
tags: Data
---

Starting from this season, I set up a bot to draw xG maps for all matches from the top leagues. Here are the more interesting results.

## Disclaimer

I implemented the bot and drew all xG maps myself, but the idea and design comes 100% from [Michael Caley](https://twitter.com/mc_of_a).

## Upsets

Let's start with upsets. You can't find a better way to visualize them than xG maps.

Bochum upset both Bayern and Dortmund in a jaw-dropping way.

Mainz, on the other hand, thrashed Bayern in a convincing fashion.

## Regrets

Atalanta didn't get the points they really deserved against strong opponents.

## Premier League Wonders

You won't believe Villa pushed City this far just from this map.

## The Incredible Run

The best against-the-xG run this season goes to our latest Champions League winner, Real Madrid.
