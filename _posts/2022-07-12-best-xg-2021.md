title: Best xG Maps from Season 21/22
tags: Data
---

Starting from this season, I set up a bot to draw xG maps for all matches from the top leagues. Here are the more interesting results.

## Disclaimer

I implemented the bot and drew all xG maps myself, but the idea and design comes 100% from [Michael Caley](https://twitter.com/mc_of_a).

## Upsets

Let's start with upsets. You can't find a better way to visualize them than xG maps.

Bochum surprised a lot of people when they successfully stayed in Bundesliga this season. The icing on the cake is two jaw-dropping upsets against Bayern and Dortmund.

Mainz, managed to go beyond scores. They thrashed Bayern in a convincing fashion.

## Regrets

Atalanta has been fantastic in the recent years. But this season, Atalanta didn't get the points they really deserved against strong opponents.

## Premier League Wonders

You won't believe Villa pushed City this far just from this map.

Steven Bergwijn's late double strike justified Tottenham's xG supremacy.

## The Incredible Run

The best against-the-xG run this season goes to our latest Champions League winner, Real Madrid.

Of course, Eintracht Frankfurt has a similar-but-less-wild run in Europa League too, but they are favoured by xG in the final.
