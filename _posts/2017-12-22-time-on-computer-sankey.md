Recently I started tracking my time on computer with [rescuetime](https://www.rescuetime.com/). It summarizes and categorizes your working patterns, but as a data-scientist-to-be, there's much more work to do, obviously.

## Sankey diagram

Inspired by a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/7jaq1j/8356_hours_on_the_computer_over_the_last_4_years/?st=jbhpsbvx&sh=666d2aa8), I was able to create a sankey diagram of my own:

The data was collected over a 10-day span from December 13th to 22th. I have a deadline this week so I did more programming and less entertainment and gaming.

Hopefully I could keep up with this trend and visualize it again months later.
