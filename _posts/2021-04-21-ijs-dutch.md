In linguistics, Dutch is in the same subgroup, namely West Germanic Languages, of Germanic Language family. Apart from Dutch, this subgroup includes two of the most spoken languages in the world: English and German. Similar to English, the Dutch alphabet has 26 letters, and the last 3 are `x`, `y`, `z` respectively.

However, in Dutch, the letter `y` is sometimes written as `ij`. They are homonyms, and should be interchangeable in almost all situations. Just like the letter `ß` in German, `ij` is not just a [_ligature_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(writing)), but also __a/one letter__. Many believes that `ij` should be the 27th letter of the Dutch Alphabet, or `ij` should completely replace `y`.

It is not clear now whether the suggestions would be considered, but the omitting of `y` is overwhelmingly accepted in primary education. As a vowel, `ij` looks more comfortable than `y`. For example, `ijsbeer` (polar bear) is easier to understand for six-year-old. But `ysbeer` or any word starting with `y` seems a bit weird, and it becomes only weirder when followed by consonants.

Another situation where `ij` is widely adopted is the names of people and places, especially due to historical reasons:

- `IJlst` (city in the Netherlands)
- `IJssel` (river in the Netherlands)

An interesting phenomenon in the above examples is that both `i` and `j` are capitalized. It further supports the argument that `ij` is __one__ letter. The phenomenon is so special because it is unparalleled in other mainstream European languages. The German `ß` is considered as a letter, but it is never used at the start of a word. The Spanish ligature `ll` is no longer considered a letter. When at the start of the word, only the first `l` should be capitalized, like `Llamar` (to call).

On the other hand, `ij` in names are sometimes deliberately changed to `y` as a part of the [_anglicisation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicisation_of_names#Dutch_surnames) process. The change is mainly for commercial and globalization purposes. Examples are:

- `Ruud van Nistelrooy` (ex football player, formerly `Nistelrooij`)
- `Feyenoord` (football club, formerly `Feijenoord`)
- `Spyker` (car manufacturer, formerly `Spijker`)
