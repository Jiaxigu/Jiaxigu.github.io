The second season of _Rate the Drip_ has kicked off.

## Criteria

Drinking coffee is a personal experience, so I have to do some research before putting everything into a numerical scale.

The descriptive criteria don't judge if a coffee is good or bad, they describe the coffee's traits or factual characteristics. 

- Roast level (which implies acidity): light, medium, dark.
- Identity: One or multiple comparable tastes to define the coffee's main identity.
- Price: Price/performance ratio also has a say in the whole experience.

On the contrary, the evaluative criteria shows how much credit I give to each aspect of a coffee. 

- Flavor (30%): Are the flavor characteristics evident, pleasant and special? 
- Aftertaste (30%): Is the aftertaste durable and consistent over time? Does it have a pleasant twist?
- Texture (30%): Body, balance, clean cup and other factors that contribute to the oral experience.
- Aroma (10%): The nasal experience.


## Setup

- grinder: Mavo Wizard
- steeper: Hario Switch
- scale: Timemore Black Mirror 2
- technique: water-first steep
- coffee to water: 1g to 16ml
- duration: 90s steep and circa. 60s filtration

Following are the detailed reviews sorted by price in descending order.

#### Black Diamond Panama Elvira Geisha Washed

  - **Light Roast, Tea and Mango, 55¥/100g**
  - **Flavor: 7** Driven by a flower-scented tea feel, hints of tropical fruit sporadically tease around.
  - **Aftertaste: 6** Misses some twist to make it a great drip, but solid overall.
  - **Texture: 5** Agressive texture and very hard to control when brewing.
  - **Aroma: 8** Refreshing herbal tea aroma overall. Then a feel of tropical beach breezes through and makes everything else less important.
  - **Summary: Almost a pure perfume.**

#### MQ Ethiopia Guji Buku Abel Natural

  - **Light Roast, Citrus, 30.4¥/100g**

  - **Aftertaste: 6** The fruity first-touch develops fast, but a bit too transient.
  - **Texture: 6** Lacks body, but overall balanced and easy to control.
  - **Aroma: 6** Tropical aroma, consistent but shallow.

#### MQ Ethiopia Geisha G1 Natural

  - **Light Roast, Tea and Honey, 23.7¥/100g**
  - **Flavor: 6** Honey tea flavor overall.
  - **Aftertaste: 7** Very good development after the tea touch. Seasoned fruit sweetness emerges, and persists like forever.
  - **Texture: 5** Balance is lacking.
  - **Aroma: 6** Average tea-like aroma. More powerful aroma indeed from the beans, but not enough for that extra point.
  - **Summary: Works fine as a introducer to the geisha world.**

#### Counter Culture Hologram Blend

  - **Summary: A problem-free daily-driver.**

#### MQ Papua New Guinea Baroida Arusha Natural

  - **Light Roast, Plum, 16.1¥/100g**
  - **Flavor: 6** Signature sour-sweetness that resembles the other Arusha.
  - **Aftertaste: 5** Still the sourness builds up and fails to impress, especially after cooling down.
  - **Texture: 6** Dry and sharp. Just like when you swallow up too much tomato.
  - **Aroma: 7** Dense aroma that usually comes from a deeper roast. I call it armors from ancient landlord.
  - **Summary: The more balanced Arusha, but still a bit too volatile.**
