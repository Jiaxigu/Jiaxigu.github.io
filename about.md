Welcome to my little digital cabin.

I attended Zhejiang University (B.S. class of 2015) and École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (M.S. class of 2018).

I'm employed at Alibaba Cloud, with focus on Anomaly Detection and AIOps Platforms.

Occasionally I work with side projects sparked by two passions: sports and languages.

You can reach me via [Email](mailto:mcjxgu@163.com). Open to job and business inquiries.
