## Welcome!

This blog is about data analysis and visualization, mainly with python.

Data science and sports can be a sweet mix. If you enjoy both, we would have a nice chat. The statement stands at a confidence level of 95% - The other 5% being you are a supporter of Real Madrid.

## Me

I'm **Jiaxi Gu**, a data scientist, sports fanatic, wanna-be polyglot, zealot of algorithmic music.

I study **Computational Science** at **École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne**, Switzerland. 

## Looking for

I will join **Alibaba Cloud** in autumn 2018.

Now I look for **data analysis side projects** involving **sports** or **linguistics**, just for fun.
