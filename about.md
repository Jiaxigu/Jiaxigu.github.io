Welcome to my secret little cabin.

I attended Zhejiang University (BS class of 2015) and EPFL (MS class of 2018).

I'm currently employed at Alibaba Cloud, specialized in Anomaly Detection and AIOps Platforms.

Also I have huge interest in sports and languages. Sometimes I do projects of these topics, for fun.

You can reach me via [Email](mailto:mcjxgu@163.com). Job and business inquiries are welcome.
